Energy_usage = 0 - power is still within limit
Energy_usage = 1 - power is above set limit of 2 watts

If power is less 2watts, energy usage is considered low with and therefore the microwave stays on and if power is above 2watts, Energy usage is considered high and therefore, the system will spike a shutdown to save energy
